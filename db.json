 What are the biggest private schools in Turkmenistan?\n\nTurkmenistan is a country that is located in Central Asia. The education system in Turkmenistan is highly centralized and the government plays a significant role in the management and provision of education. The Ministry of Education oversees all levels of education in Turkmenistan from pre-school to post-secondary education. There are several types of schools in Turkmenistan, including public schools, private schools, and international schools.\n\nThe majority of schools in Turkmenistan are public schools. However, there has been an increase in the number of private schools in recent years. Private schools are tuition-based and typically cater to affluent families. The biggest private schools in Turkmenistan include the Ahalteke International School, the American International School of Ashgabat, and the British School of Ashgabat.\n\nThe Ahalteke International School is a prestigious private school that offers instruction in English and Russian. The school has a student body of over 1,000 students and provides a rigorous academic program that prepares students for college admission. The American International School of Ashgabat is another prestigious private school that offers instruction in English. The school has a student body of over 400 students and offers a comprehensive academic program that includes Advanced Placement courses. The British School of Ashgabat is a private school that offers instruction in English. The school has a student body of over 200 students and offers a challenging curriculum that prepares students for university admission.\n\n#  How many students are enrolled in private schools in Turkmenistan?\n\nIt is estimated that there are currently around 12,000 students enrolled in private schools in Turkmenistan. This number is growing rapidly, as parents are increasingly attracted to the high quality of education offered by private schools.
