Luckily for Wisconsin residents, there are some places where you can gamble tax-free and report your winnings on your WI return! In this article, we’ll tell you where to find these casinos and what to do when you visit them.</p>
<p>Wisconsin has two tribal casinos that offer casino gaming: the Potawatomi Bingo Casino in Milwaukee and the Menominee Casino Resort in Keshena. These casinos offer a variety of games, including slots, blackjack, craps, roulette, and poker. The Potawatomi Bingo Casino is the bigger of the two casinos with over 2,000 slot machines and nearly 50 table games.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for more options, there are plenty of other casinos nearby. Just across the border in Illinois, you can find the Hollywood Casino Aurora, Harrah’s Joliet Hotel &amp; Casino, and the Ameristar East Chicago Casino. If you head up to Michigan, you can visit the Soaring Eagle Casino &amp; Resort or the FireKeepers Casino Hotel.</p>
<p>If you’re planning on visiting a casino, be sure to familiarize yourself with the rules of the game first. Most casinos have websites where you can learn about the games offered and their rules. You should also know what forms of identification you’ll need to bring with you. Generally, you’ll need a valid driver’s license or state ID card.</p>
<p>Once you’ve decided on which casino to visit, it’s time to start planning your trip! Most casinos offer discounts on rooms and food for people who are playing at the casino. Be sure to ask about these discounts when you make your reservation. You may also want to check out the casino’s website for information on concerts and other events that may be happening while you’re there.</p>
<p>When you arrive at the casino, be sure to sign up for a player’s card. This card will track your play and award points that can be redeemed for rewards like free meals or room discounts. You’ll also want to make a note of any betting limits that are in place so that you don’t go over your budget.</p>
<p>Gambling can be a fun way to pass some time away but it’s important to remember that it’s not always risk-free. Be sure to gamble responsibly and know when to stop playing. Have fun and good luck at the casino!</p>
