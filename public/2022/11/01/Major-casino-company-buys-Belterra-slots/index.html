The deal, which is said to be in the tens of millions of dollars, was announced earlier this week and is sure to bring new life to the aging facility.</p>
<p>Sources close to the deal say that representatives from the casino giant were on site at Belterra just two days after the slots were placed on sale. They wasted no time in making an offer that was accepted by the resort’s owners.</p>
<p>Belterra’s slot machines have been a popular destination for players in the area for years. The casino company that purchased them plans to update and improve the games, as well as add new ones. This is good news for players who have grown attached to the current offerings.</p>
<p>The purchase comes at a time when Belterra is facing some financial difficulties. The resort has been dealing with a decline in attendance in recent years, and its owners are hopeful that this new arrangement will help turn things around.</p>
<p>Casino giants are known for their lavish resorts and top-of-the-line games. It will be exciting to see what they do with Belterra and how it impacts tourism in southern Indiana.</p>
<h1 id="Penn-National-Gaming-buys-Belterra-casino-slots"><a href="#Penn-National-Gaming-buys-Belterra-casino-slots" class="headerlink" title="Penn National Gaming buys Belterra casino slots"></a>Penn National Gaming buys Belterra casino slots</h1><p>Penn National Gaming has announced the purchase of the Belterra casino slots operation from Boyd Gaming.</p>
<p>The deal, worth $141 million, will see Penn National take full control of the 1,032-machine casino. The purchase also includes a development agreement for a new property in the Cincinnati area.</p>
<p>Belterra is located on the Indiana-Ohio border, and is one of the smaller casinos in Penn National’s portfolio. The move is seen as a way to bolster revenues for the company ahead of an anticipated increase in competition from new casinos in Ohio.</p>
<p>Boyd Gaming said that it would use the proceeds from the sale to reduce its debtload.</p>
