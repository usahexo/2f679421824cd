The casino, which opened in 1997, is the largest in Maryland, and has more than 2,000 slot machines and 100 table games.</p>
<p>The current owner, billionaire Carl Icahn, announced earlier this year that he would sell the casino. He cited the need to focus on his other businesses as the reason for selling.</p>
<p>There has been speculation that the casino will be bought by MGM Resorts International, which is currently building a casino in National Harbor, just outside of Washington D.C. However, no buyer has yet been announced.</p>
<p>The Taj Mahal Casino is a major employer in Ocean City, with more than 1,000 employees. It is also a major tourist attraction, bringing in millions of visitors each year.</p>
<h1 id="Who-owns-the-Taj-Mahal-Casino-in-Ocean-City"><a href="#Who-owns-the-Taj-Mahal-Casino-in-Ocean-City" class="headerlink" title="Who owns the Taj Mahal Casino in Ocean City?"></a>Who owns the Taj Mahal Casino in Ocean City?</h1><p>The Taj Mahal Casino in Ocean City is a landmark and popular destination for tourists. The casino is owned by the city’s mayor and his family.</p>
<h1 id="Proposal-to-sell-the-Taj-Mahal-Casino-in-Ocean-City"><a href="#Proposal-to-sell-the-Taj-Mahal-Casino-in-Ocean-City" class="headerlink" title="Proposal to sell the Taj Mahal Casino in Ocean City"></a>Proposal to sell the Taj Mahal Casino in Ocean City</h1><p>The Taj Mahal Casino in Ocean City, New Jersey, could be up for sale. The casino, which first opened its doors in 1978, is one of the most recognizable and popular casinos on the East Coast.</p>
<p>There has been no confirmation yet as to who is selling the property or what the asking price might be, but industry experts believe that the casino could fetch a price tag of more than $1 billion.</p>
<p>The current owner of the Taj Mahal Casino is Carl Icahn, who acquired it as part of his purchase of Trump Entertainment Resorts in 2016. Icahn has not commented publicly on any plans to sell the casino.</p>
<p>If the Taj Mahal Casino is indeed sold, it would mark the second time in just a few years that a high-profile casino in Ocean City has been put up for sale. The Revel Casino Hotel was sold at auction in 2014 for just $82 million after declaring bankruptcy for the second time.</p>
<p>The Taj Mahal Casino is one of three casinos in Ocean City; the other two are operated by Caesar’s Entertainment Corporation and Golden Nugget Atlantic City.</p>
<h1 id="The-future-of-the-Taj-Mahal-Casino-in-Ocean-City"><a href="#The-future-of-the-Taj-Mahal-Casino-in-Ocean-City" class="headerlink" title="The future of the Taj Mahal Casino in Ocean City"></a>The future of the Taj Mahal Casino in Ocean City</h1><p>Since it opened in 1985, the Taj Mahal Casino has been a staple of Ocean City’s boardwalk. But with its parent company filing for bankruptcy, the future of the Taj is uncertain.</p>
<p>The casino is owned by Trump Entertainment Resorts, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last month. It is unclear what will happen to the casino if it is sold or liquidated.</p>
<p>Many local officials are hoping that the casino will be acquired by a new owner and remain open. But there are also concerns that the casino could be closed and turned into a hotel or another type of development.</p>
<p>Whatever happens, the Taj Mahal Casino will have a major impact on Ocean City. It is one of the largest employers in the area and it generates millions of dollars in revenue each year.</p>
<h1 id="Is-the-Taj-Mahal-Casino-in-Ocean-City-for-sale"><a href="#Is-the-Taj-Mahal-Casino-in-Ocean-City-for-sale" class="headerlink" title="Is the Taj Mahal Casino in Ocean City for sale?"></a>Is the Taj Mahal Casino in Ocean City for sale?</h1><p>Rumors have been swirling for months that the iconic Taj Mahal Casino may be up for sale. The casino, which has been a fixture in Ocean City since its opening in 1985, is said to be on the market for $300 million.</p>
<p>While company officials have yet to confirm these rumors, there are several indicators that suggest that a sale may be in the works. First, the casino’s parent company, Trump Entertainment Resorts, recently emerged from bankruptcy and is looking to sell off non-essential assets. Additionally, the casino’s property taxes were significantly increased this year, and it is believed that the owners may not be able to afford to keep it open much longer.</p>
<p>If the Taj Mahal Casino does end up being sold, it would likely mean big changes for Ocean City. The new owners would likely want to redevelop the property into a more upscale resort. This could mean higher costs for visitors and fewer jobs for locals.</p>
