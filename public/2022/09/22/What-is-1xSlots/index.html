How many teams are in Juventus FC?"></a>2. How many teams are in Juventus FC?</h1><p>3 teams are in Juventus FC. These are Juventus F.C., Old Lady, and Bianconeri.</p>
<h1 id="There-are-30-teams-in-Juventus-FC"><a href="#There-are-30-teams-in-Juventus-FC" class="headerlink" title="There are 30 teams in Juventus FC."></a>There are 30 teams in Juventus FC.</h1><p>The club was founded in Turin, Piedmont, in 1897 as Sport-Club Juventus by a group of young Torinese students inspired by the English club Notts County.<br>They became the dominant team in Italian football in the 1930s and have won the title of champions 34 times, making them the most successful club in Italy.</p>
<p>In 1934, they became the first Italian team to win the European Cup, which they achieved by beating Czechoslovakia 2–1 in the final. They reached their second consecutive final in Vecchia Signora (Old Lady) – as they are called by their fans – lost 5–3 to Liverpool but emerged victorious two years later, when Stoke City were defeated 1–0 in the 1976 UEFA final replay.</p>
<p>Juventus hold joint membership with S.S.C. Napoli and A.S. Roma; all three clubs are owned by one company through a Holding called “Impsa”. As a result of this arrangement, players from these three clubs can only play for other clubs within Serie A on loan until they are sold or reach an agreement with their parent club over first-team opportunities; this led to Juventus fielding weakened teams towards the end of 2006-07 season as Siena and Rimini both had a number of their players temporarily recalled for first-team duties at Juve’s expense. In 2009–10 season, however, Juventus loaned out more players than any other club in Serie A (eight), and also sent 26 players out on permanent deals. For 2010-11 season, this number was reduced to 15 loanees and 10 permanently transferred players; 5 of which left for other Italian clubs and 5 for foreign clubs.<br>After selling stars like Zlatan Ibrahimović, Fabio Cannavaro and Pavel Nedvěd (and not replacing them adequately), Juventus went into the 2007–08 season knowing that it would be hard to defend their league title even though they made several big name signings such as Alberto Gilardino, Alessandro del Piero, Lilian Thuram and Emerson). The title defence started poorly with a home draw against Catania followed by an away loss at ChievoVerona; they then recorded four consecutive wins before two losses (one home, one away) allowed Milan back into contention. After another streak of positive results however Juve regained pole position with two games remaining and eventually won their 26th “Scudetto” championship on 5 May 2008 after a 3–1 victory at Arezzo secured enough points to clinch the title ahead of Inter Milan (who had lost 2–1 away at Udinese). The following season saw Juventus finish runners up behind Inter Milan but claiming notable scalps along the way such as eventual Champions League winners Barcelona 3–1 at Camp Nou whom they also beat twice during the domestic campaign while hammering reigning Scudetto holders Inter 7−0 at home including Milito getting sent off early as well as 3rd placed Lazio 6−3 at Rome Derby match , leaving them cup-tied for Coppa Italia .<br>On 11 July 2009, Juventus acquired 50% shares of SampdoriaSpA., thus becoming joint-owners of the club; Andrea Della Valle bought Sampdoria outright on 31 August 2009 becoming sole owner . During 2011−12 season Juventus went down finalists in 2012 UEFA Europa League losing 4−2 on aggregate against Spanish side Atlético Madrid . Midway through that same season Antonio Conte was appointed as new head coach succeeding LuigiDelneri ; he brought about tactical changes that resulted in an unprecedented Serie A winning streak , also leading Juventus to their first ever Coppa Italia victory since 1995 and third consecutive Supercoppa Italiana title , being onlyitable clubs after Milan (7) and Inter (5) ; reaching semi finals where they narrowly lost out to eventual Champions Bayern Munich 3−1 over two legs<br>In August 2013 Conte resigned due to his intention to take charge of Italy national football team after Euro 2016 qualifying campaign , later starting his coaching career there . Aftermath saw Massimiliano Allegri being appointed new head coach on 18 July 2014 signing a two-year contract worth €4 million salary per year<br>After just one season where Juve finished 4th place missing out UCL spot Allegri renewed his contract till 2020 keeping him at helm . On 22 May 2017 chairman Andrea Agnelli raised eyebrows across world football announcing unilateral decision to quit FIFA &amp; sign contract extension withJuventus till 2022 ; despite threats from authorities president denied committing any wrongdoing<br>One man who will always be linked with Juventus is Michel Platini ; former player for French side Saint Etienne between 1976 and 1992 , he representedJuventus between 1982 and 1987 winning three scudetti titles . He was also very successful as President of Union des Associations Européennes de Football (UEFA) serving from 2007 until 2015 - who coinc</p>
