<h1 id="Why-are-these-authors-and-books-so-popular-in-education"><a href="#Why-are-these-authors-and-books-so-popular-in-education" class="headerlink" title="Why are these authors and books so popular in education?"></a>Why are these authors and books so popular in education?</h1><p>John Dewey, along with Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, is considered one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century. He was a leader in the progressive education movement in the United States and his ideas have been influential in both primary and higher education.</p>
<p>Dewey’s writing explores issues such as the relationship between democracy and education, the nature of knowledge and experience, and the role of technology in society. His most famous book, ‘The Experience and Education’, was published in 1938. In it, Dewey argues that education should be based on experiences that are relevant to students’ lives. He also emphasises the importance of collaboration and democratic decision-making in schools.</p>
<p>Another influential American educator is William James. James was a psychologist and philosopher who believed that learning should be an active process that involves experimentation and exploration. He was one of the founders of functional psychology, which studies how people use their mental abilities to solve problems.</p>
<p>James is best known for his book ‘The Principles of Psychology’, which was published in 1890. In it, he describes how people perceive stimuli from their environment, form beliefs, and make decisions. He also discusses human emotions and motivation.</p>
<p>Many contemporary educators are influenced by Paulo Freire’s theories on critical pedagogy. Freire was a Brazilian educator who believed that students should be involved in creating their own educational materials. He argued that schools should be used to promote social change and challenge inequality.</p>
<p>Freire’s most famous work is ‘Pedagogy of the Oppressed’, which was first published in Portuguese in 1968. In it, he discusses how teachers can help oppressed students become aware of their own power and advocate for change. Freire’s work has been very influential in teacher training programs around the world.</p>
<h1 id="How-does-using-these-authors-and-books-benefit-students"><a href="#How-does-using-these-authors-and-books-benefit-students" class="headerlink" title="How does using these authors and books benefit students?"></a>How does using these authors and books benefit students?</h1><p>When selecting books to read in school, teachers and students alike often consider the authors’ backgrounds, awards, and other noteworthy features. However, there are several additional benefits to using these authors and books in the classroom.</p>
<p>One such benefit is that using these authors and books helps students understand literature from a variety of perspectives. This not only makes the literature more relatable but also allows students to see how different people approach writing. Additionally, by reading works by award-winning authors, students can learn more about what constitutes high-quality writing. As a result, they may be better able to identify and emulate these qualities in their own work.</p>
<p>Another benefit of using these authors and books is that it exposes students to a wider range of topics. Many times, award-winning authors tackle serious or complex issues in their books. By reading these books, students can gain a deeper understanding of these topics and learn how to discuss them intelligently. Additionally, exposure to different points of view can help students develop empathy for others.</p>
<p>Finally, using these authors and books can help improve students’ reading skills. Often times, the language used in award-winning books is more sophisticated than that found in most contemporary literature. As a result, reading such texts can help improve students’ vocabulary and grammar skills. Additionally, reading complex texts can help train students’ brains to focus on important information while ignoring irrelevant details. This skill is essential for success in college and beyond.</p>
<p>In summary, there are several benefits to using these authors and books in the classroom. By exposing students to high-quality writing and complex topics, teachers can help them become better readers and thinkers.</p>
