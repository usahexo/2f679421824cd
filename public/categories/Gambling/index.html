		<h1 id="Texas-lawmaker-wants-to-increase-penalties-for-gambling-on-the-web"><a href="#Texas-lawmaker-wants-to-increase-penalties-for-gambling-on-the-web" class="headerlink" title="Texas lawmaker wants to increase penalties for gambling on the web"></a>Texas lawmaker wants to increase penalties for gambling on the web</h1><p>Texas State Representative and House Speaker Pro Tem Dennis Bonnen has proposed a measure that would significantly increase the penalties for gambling online. If passed, the law would make it a felony to gamble online, punishable by up to two years in prison and a $10,000 fine.</p>
<p>Currently, gambling online is a Class C misdemeanor in Texas, punishable by a fine of up to $500. Under Bonnen’s proposed measure, the maximum penalty for gambling online would be the same as the penalty for gambling at a casino - a felony punishable by two years in prison and a $10,000 fine.</p>
<p>Bonnen says that his proposal is needed to combat the growing problem of internet gambling. “Online gambling is a growing epidemic that is destroying lives and families across the country,” Bonnen said in a statement. “This proposal will put an end to this scourge and send a strong message that Texas will not tolerate this form of illegal activity.”</p>
<p>Opponents of the measure argue that it could have unintended consequences, such as driving people who gamble online underground where they would be harder to track and prosecute. They also argue that increasing the penalties for gambling will do nothing to address the underlying problem of addiction.</p>
<h1 id="Texas-is-looking-to-crackdown-on-illegal-gambling-activity"><a href="#Texas-is-looking-to-crackdown-on-illegal-gambling-activity" class="headerlink" title="Texas is looking to crackdown on illegal gambling activity"></a>Texas is looking to crackdown on illegal gambling activity</h1><p>Texas lawmakers are looking to crack down on illegal gambling activity throughout the state. The proposed bill, HB 2159, would make it a Class A misdemeanor to operate an illegal gambling device or to promote illegal gambling. The bill would also make it a Class B misdemeanor to possess an illegal gambling device.</p>
<p>Illegal gambling is a widespread problem in Texas. In order to address this problem, lawmakers need to pass HB 2159. This bill would help protect Texans from the negative consequences of illegal gambling, including addiction, financial ruin, and crime.</p>
<p>Illegal gambling can have devastating consequences for individuals and families. Gambling addiction can ruin lives and relationships. Financial ruin can befall people who lose large sums of money while gambling. Criminal activity often accompanies illegal gambling, putting people at risk of violence and incarceration.</p>
<p>HB 2159 would help address these negative consequences by making it easier for law enforcement officials to crackdown on illegal gambling activity. This bill would also provide much-needed education about the dangers of gambling addiction and how to seek help if you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling problem.</p>
<p>If you’re concerned about the impact of illegal gambling in Texas, please urge your lawmakers to support HB 2159.</p>
<h1 id="Stiffer-penalties-proposed-for-online-gambling-in-Texas"><a href="#Stiffer-penalties-proposed-for-online-gambling-in-Texas" class="headerlink" title="Stiffer penalties proposed for online gambling in Texas"></a>Stiffer penalties proposed for online gambling in Texas</h1><p>Online gambling is illegal in Texas, but a new proposal would stiffen the penalties for those caught engaging in the activity.</p>
<p>Senate Bill 649, introduced by State Senator Joan Huffman, calls for fines of up to $10,000 for individuals caught gambling online and up to $100,000 for companies caught facilitating online gambling in Texas. The bill also includes a provision that would allow the state to confiscate any assets used in connection with online gambling.</p>
<p>“Illegal gambling is a massive industry that preys on everyday Texans,” Huffman said in a statement. “This bill cracks down on the criminal activity and protects consumers from being scammed.”</p>
<p>Texas has been aggressive in its efforts to enforce its gambling laws in recent years. In 2017, the state reached a settlement with major internet service providers, including AT&amp;T, Comcast and Verizon, requiring them to block access to all known illegal gambling websites.</p>
<p>Opponents of SB 649 argue that it will do more harm than good, punishing law-abiding Texas citizens who enjoy playing poker or other casino games online while doing nothing to combat the actual operators of illegal gambling sites.</p>
<h1 id="Proposed-bill-in-Texas-would-increase-penalties-for-online-gambling"><a href="#Proposed-bill-in-Texas-would-increase-penalties-for-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Proposed bill in Texas would increase penalties for online gambling"></a>Proposed bill in Texas would increase penalties for online gambling</h1><p>The state of Texas is considering a new bill that would increase the penalties for online gambling. The proposed bill, House Bill 747, was introduced by State Representative Jose Menendez back in February and awaits review by the House Committee on Criminal Jurisprudence.</p>
<p>Under the current law, engaging in online gambling is a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail and a $4,000 fine. The proposed bill would increase the penalties to a third degree felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.</p>
<p>“This legislation will help keep Texans safe and protect our economy from the harmful effects of illegal gambling operations,” Menendez said in a statement when he introduced the bill.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it will do more harm than good, infringing on people’s rights and leading to costly arrests and prosecutions. Supporters argue that it is important to deter people from engaging in illegal gambling activity and protect the public from its many risks.</p>
<p>The proposed bill is just one of many efforts around the country to crackdown on online gambling. In December last year, President Donald Trump signed into law the Safe Ports Act, which prohibits all forms of internet gambling.</p>
<h1 id="Texas-mulls-harsher-penalties-for-online-gambling"><a href="#Texas-mulls-harsher-penalties-for-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Texas mulls harsher penalties for online gambling"></a>Texas mulls harsher penalties for online gambling</h1><p>The state of Texas is considering stricter penalties for those caught gambling online.</p>
<p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton recently testified before the state Senate Committee on Criminal Justice, in support of a bill that would increase the penalties for those caught gambling online from a Class C misdemeanor to a Class A misdemeanor.</p>
<p>“Gambling is illegal in Texas under both state and federal law,” Paxton said. “This increase in penalty will help deter people from engaging in this criminal activity.”</p>
<p>Paxton added that the proposed bill would also help law enforcement officials prosecute those engaged in online gambling, as the current penalty is not strong enough to deter them.</p>
<p>The proposed bill has been met with some criticism, with some arguing that it unfairly targets low-income individuals who may be more likely to gamble online. Others argue that the increased penalty could lead to more people being incarcerated, and is not the best way to address the issue of online gambling.</p>

		<h1 id="Washington-State-Casino-Funds-Allotted-to-Various-Causes"><a href="#Washington-State-Casino-Funds-Allotted-to-Various-Causes" class="headerlink" title="Washington State Casino Funds Allotted to Various Causes"></a>Washington State Casino Funds Allotted to Various Causes</h1><p>$100 million dollars has been set aside to be divided amongst various organizations and projects in the state of Washington. Governor Jay Inslee has announced the recipients of the state’s casino funds, which will be used for homeless services, college scholarships, and clean energy.</p>
<p>The largest chunk of the casino money, $40 million, will go towards homeless services. This will include building new shelters, increasing mental health and addiction treatment services, and helping people find permanent housing. Another $20 million will go to providing college scholarships for low- and middle-income students. And finally, $10 million will be put towards developing clean energy sources in the state.</p>
<p>This is great news for the people of Washington State! The casino funds will help many people in need, and will also support important causes like homelessness prevention and clean energy development.</p>
<h1 id="30-Million-Allocated-from-Washington-State-Casino-Funds"><a href="#30-Million-Allocated-from-Washington-State-Casino-Funds" class="headerlink" title="$30 Million Allocated from Washington State Casino Funds"></a>$30 Million Allocated from Washington State Casino Funds</h1><p>In an attempt to bolster the state’s sagging economy, lawmakers voted unanimously on Wednesday to allocate $30 million from Washington State casino funds to various projects around the state. The projects that will be funded by the money were chosen based on a number of factors, including their ability to create jobs and stimulate economic growth.</p>
<p>Some of the larger allocations include $10 million for the renovation of Seattle’s KeyArena, $5 million for the construction of a new tribal casino in Suquamish, and $4.5 million for the expansion of a business incubation center in Spokane. Other notable projects that will benefit from the gambling revenue include a new convention center in Tacoma, road improvements in Vancouver, and a new agricultural research center in Mount Vernon.</p>
<p>Governor Jay Inslee praised the move, stating that it would help create jobs and grow the economy. He also noted that it was important to invest in a variety of different projects, as this would help ensure that all regions of Washington State benefited from the casino funding. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mark Schoesler also voiced his support for the measure, noting that it would help create much-needed jobs throughout rural parts of the state.</p>
<p>The approval of the funding comes at a time when Washington State is facing significant budgetary challenges. In order to make up for a nearly $2 billion shortfall, lawmakers have had to make steep cuts to a number of important programs. By allocating money from the state’s casino funds, they are able to provide some relief while also investing in long-term projects that should help spur economic growth.</p>
<h1 id="Washington-State-Casino-Funds-to-be-Used-for-Drug-Enforcement"><a href="#Washington-State-Casino-Funds-to-be-Used-for-Drug-Enforcement" class="headerlink" title="Washington State Casino Funds to be Used for Drug Enforcement"></a>Washington State Casino Funds to be Used for Drug Enforcement</h1><p>On October 16, 2018, it was announced that Washington State casino funds will now be used for drug enforcement purposes. This change in policy comes after two years of study by the Washington State Gambling Commission (WSGC) and is designed to help address the state’s growing opioid epidemic.</p>
<p>Up until now, casino funds were only used for regulatory and enforcement activities in the gambling industry. However, with the number of opioid overdose deaths in Washington State reaching an all-time high, the WSGC believes that using casino funds to help address the opioid crisis is a critical step.</p>
<p>The new policy will allow casino funds to be used for a number of different purposes related to drug enforcement, including:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Funding law enforcement efforts aimed at stopping the trafficking of illegal drugs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Providing support for drug rehabilitation programs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Supporting education and awareness initiatives about the dangers of drug addiction.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Helping families affected by drug addiction get the support they need.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>According to Commission Chair Jane Goodwin, “The WSGC has long been concerned about the impact of gambling on overall public health and safety in our state…This new policy is another example of how we are working to address those concerns.” She also noted that using casino funds for drug enforcement would “help keep our communities safe from the scourge of opioids and other illegal drugs.”</p>
<h1 id="More-than-Half-of-Washington-State-Casino-Funds-Allotted-for-Education"><a href="#More-than-Half-of-Washington-State-Casino-Funds-Allotted-for-Education" class="headerlink" title="More than Half of Washington State Casino Funds Allotted for Education"></a>More than Half of Washington State Casino Funds Allotted for Education</h1><p>It was announced earlier this week that Washington state casinos would be donating more than half of their funds to education. This is great news for the state as a whole, and for the students who will be receiving the money.</p>
<p>According to officials, $61 million will be donated to education from the state’s casinos this year. That number is expected to grow in the years to come, as new casinos open up in the state. The money will be used to fund a variety of educational programs, from basic education initiatives all the way up to higher education scholarships.</p>
<p>This is a huge win not just for the students, but also for the casino industry in Washington state. Casino operators have been working hard to get this agreement in place, and it’s great to see them contributing so much money back into the community.</p>
<p>A big part of this agreement is that the money will be used specifically for educational purposes. It cannot be used for things like administrative costs or building repairs. This ensures that the money goes directly towards helping students learn and achieve their goals.</p>
<p>In addition to this large donation, casino operators have also agreed to provide additional funding for after-school programs and other student enrichment activities. This will help keep kids busy and out of trouble, and it will give them something fun and productive to do after school hours.</p>
<p>This is a major victory for Washington state, and it’s going to make a big difference in the lives of students across the state. Thanks to the hard work of casino operators and educators alike, future generations are going to have access to a top-notch education.</p>
<h1 id="Washington-Governor-Announces-Plan-for-Washington-State-Casino-Funds"><a href="#Washington-Governor-Announces-Plan-for-Washington-State-Casino-Funds" class="headerlink" title="Washington Governor Announces Plan for Washington State Casino Funds"></a>Washington Governor Announces Plan for Washington State Casino Funds</h1><p>Governor Jay Inslee has announced a plan for the distribution of $100 million in casino funds to various statewide programs. The money will be used to improve mental health services, fund college scholarships, and bolster other government initiatives.</p>
<p>According to the governor’s office, the casino money will be allocated as follows:</p>
<p>$30 million for mental health services<br>$20 million for college scholarships<br>$10 million for early childhood education<br>$10 million for housing vouchers<br>$10 million for homeless youth services<br>$5 million for workforce training.</p>
<p>This is great news for Washington State residents! The infusion of casino funds will help improve critical services and programs throughout the state.</p>
