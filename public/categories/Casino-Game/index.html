		<h1 id="New-Tottenham-Hotspur-FC-Flop-Causes-Embarrassment"><a href="#New-Tottenham-Hotspur-FC-Flop-Causes-Embarrassment" class="headerlink" title="New Tottenham Hotspur FC Flop Causes Embarrassment"></a>New Tottenham Hotspur FC Flop Causes Embarrassment</h1><p>Fans of Tottenham Hotspur FC were left in shock and embarrassment after their club’s new signing caused a major fiasco on his debut.</p>
<p>The £30 million signing, who was brought in to bolster the team’s attacking options, was jeered by the home fans and substituted after just 45 minutes following a series of poor performances.</p>
<p>The player, who has asked not to be named, was said to be devastated by the reaction from the fans and is said to be considering his future at the club.</p>
<p>One fan said: “It was just embarrassing. He looked like he had no idea what he was doing and he clearly wasn’t good enough for our team. I hope he leaves soon.”</p>
<p>Tottenham Hotspur FC are currently fifth in the Premier League table and will be hoping to improve on their position with some better performances from their new signing.</p>
<h1 id="Tottenham-Hotspur-FC-New-Flop-Caught-on-Camera"><a href="#Tottenham-Hotspur-FC-New-Flop-Caught-on-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Tottenham Hotspur FC New Flop Caught on Camera"></a>Tottenham Hotspur FC New Flop Caught on Camera</h1><p>Tottenham Hotspur FC new signing Serge Aurier was caught on camera making homophobic remarks about former manager Laurent Blanc and current players Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Angel Di Maria. The comments were made as part of a live Facebook video filmed by the player in Paris ahead of his move to Tottenham.</p>
<p>The footage, which was later published by French newspaper L’Equipe, shows the 24-year-old Ivory Coast right-back making a number of derogatory remarks about gay people. In one clip, he says: “He [Blanc] is someone who likes the little boys.”</p>
<p>In another, Aurier adds: “Here we say f*** you to him [Ibrahimovic], he’s like a homosexual or something. He plays with 12 players, f*** you Zlatan.” Aurier then turns his attention to Di Maria, calling him a “f****t”.</p>
<p> Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino has since confirmed that the club are aware of the incident and are investigating the matter. In a statement released on Wednesday, Spurs said: “We are aware of reports appearing in the media regarding Serge Aurier. We have been informed by Serge and his representatives that the comments were made in jest and not meant to cause offence.</p>
<p>“We have spoken with Serge who unreservedly regrets the comments and accepts that they were not meant in an offensive way. Pleased that he has understood the severity of his words, he has now apologised for any offence caused. This behaviour will not be tolerated at Tottenham Hotspur Football Club. We shall be issuing further internal disciplinary action tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Aurier has since apologised for his comments, describing them as “inappropriate and inexcusable”. In a statement posted on Twitter, he said: “I made a mistake and I want to apologise to the fans, to Laurent Blanc, to Zlatan Ibrahimovic, to Angel Di Maria and to all the football supporters around the world. I unacceptable and inexcusable comments during a live stream chat on social media yesterday. I am deeply sorry for my actions and I regret what I said 100%. These words do not reflect my personal beliefs nor who I am as a person. I am committed to represent Tottenham Hotspur FC with integrity alongside my team mates both on and off the pitch…I ask for your understanding and forgiveness.”</p>
<h1 id="Could-New-Tottenham-Hotspur-FC-Flop-Cause-More-Problems"><a href="#Could-New-Tottenham-Hotspur-FC-Flop-Cause-More-Problems" class="headerlink" title="Could New Tottenham Hotspur FC Flop Cause More Problems?"></a>Could New Tottenham Hotspur FC Flop Cause More Problems?</h1><p>The recent signing of Vincent Janssen from AZ Alkmaar for £17 million has had many Tottenham Hotspur fans excited. The 22-year-old Dutch striker is seen as one of the most promising young players in Europe, and with Harry Kane currently the only senior striker at the club, it was seen as a necessary addition.</p>
<p>But there are now concerns that the arrival of Janssen could actually create more problems for Spurs than it solves. The main worry is that Janssen is not a natural goalscorer, and may not be able to adapt to the Premier League. In his time at AZ Alkmaar, he never scored more than 10 goals in a season, and he will find it much harder to score in England’s top division.</p>
<p>This could lead to Kane being played out of position, or even being dropped from the starting line-up. This would be a disaster for Tottenham, who are already struggling to keep up with the top teams in the Premier League. If they are without their best striker and main goal threat, they could easily finish outside of the top four this season.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it remains to be seen whether Vincent Janssen will be a success or not. But if he does struggle at Tottenham, it could cause major problems for the club and their title hopes.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-Wrong-with-Tottenham-Hotspur-FC’s-New-Flop"><a href="#What-is-Wrong-with-Tottenham-Hotspur-FC’s-New-Flop" class="headerlink" title="What is Wrong with Tottenham Hotspur FC’s New Flop?"></a>What is Wrong with Tottenham Hotspur FC’s New Flop?</h1><p>In today’s inflated transfer market, where the prices for even the most average of players has skyrocketed, Tottenham Hotspur FC’s purchase of Davinson Sanchez from Ajax for a fee in the region of £42 million looks like a bargain.</p>
<p>However, Spurs fans are already starting to question manager Mauricio Pochettino’s judgement after the Colombian centre-back failed to make an impression in his first two starts for the club.</p>
<p>Sanchez was brought in as an upgrade on Toby Alderweireld, who looked set to leave White Hart Lane before Daniel Levy upped his asking price, but the 21-year-old has so far struggled to hold down a place in the Spurs side.</p>
<p>Pochettino has insisted that Sanchez will improve with time and experience, but some sections of the Tottenham support are calling for him to be dropped from the starting XI.</p>
<p>What is wrong with Tottenham Hotspur FC’s new flop?</p>
<h1 id="Tottenham-Hotspur-FC’s-New-Flop-Who-is-to-Blame"><a href="#Tottenham-Hotspur-FC’s-New-Flop-Who-is-to-Blame" class="headerlink" title="Tottenham Hotspur FC’s New Flop: Who is to Blame?"></a>Tottenham Hotspur FC’s New Flop: Who is to Blame?</h1><p>The English Premier League football club, Tottenham Hotspur FC, has just announced their newest signing: Vincent Janssen from AZ Alkmaar. The transfer fee is set at €17 million, which is a record for both clubs.</p>
<p>Janssen is a striker who had an incredible season last year in the Dutch Eredivisie. He scored 27 goals in 34 appearances, and was one of the most in-demand strikers in Europe.</p>
<p>However, this season has not gone as planned for him. He has only scored three goals in 12 appearances, and has largely been out of favor with the manager.</p>
<p>So why did Spurs sign him? Is it simply a case of bad form, or are there other factors at play?</p>
<p>There are several possible explanations for Tottenham’s decision to sign Janssen. The first is that they may believe he still has potential and can recapture his form from last season. The second explanation is that they may need cover for Harry Kane, who is currently sidelined with an ankle injury. And finally, they may simply be looking for a cheap replacement for Emmanuel Adebayor, who was released earlier this year.</p>
<p>At this point it’s difficult to say who is to blame for Janssen’s poor form: the player himself, the manager, or even the club itself. However, one thing is for sure: Spurs made a big mistake in signing him and he is likely to be nothing more than a flop at the club.</p>
