The infographic below from <a href="https://www.casinoonline.de/blackjack-apprenticeship-infographic/" target="_blank">CasinoOnline.de</a> takes a look at when and how you should be varying your bets while playing blackjack in order to have the most successful experience possible.<br /></p>
<p>The infographic provides a general overview of when you might want to increase or decrease your bets during a game of blackjack. For instance, if you have a strong hand, it might be wise to increase your bet in order to win more money. However, if the cards are going against you, it might be time to reduce your bet in order to minimize your losses. <br /></p>
<p>Additionally, there are other factors that come into play when it comes time to make a decision about whether or not to increase or decrease your bet size. For example, understanding the dealer’s upcard is important – if they have a high card up (ten or above), then they are likely to bust on their next card, so it would be wise to increase your bet at this point. On the other hand, if the dealer has a low card up (below ten), they are likely to stick with that low number, so betting big at this point would be foolish.<br /></p>
<p>By understanding when and how to vary your bets while playing blackjack, you can give yourself the best chance possible of walking away from the table as a winner.</p>
<h1 id="‘Black-Jack-Apprenticeship-Tips-on-How-to-be-a-Better-Gambler’"><a href="#‘Black-Jack-Apprenticeship-Tips-on-How-to-be-a-Better-Gambler’" class="headerlink" title="‘Black Jack Apprenticeship: Tips on How to be a Better Gambler’"></a>‘Black Jack Apprenticeship: Tips on How to be a Better Gambler’</h1><p>Part 1</p>
<p>Almost anyone can gamble. It doesn’t take any special skills or training. However, if you want to be a successful gambler, then you need to learn the proper techniques and strategies. In this article, we will discuss some tips on how to be a better black jack apprentice.</p>
<p>First of all, it is important to understand the basic rules of black jack. In order to win, your hand must be closer to 21 than the dealer’s hand - without going over 21. You can also stand pat (not ask for another card) or hit (ask for another card) depending on your hand. You should also know when to double down and when to split pairs.</p>
<p>It is also important to have a solid understanding of probabilities and statistics. For example, you should know that the odds of getting a black jack are 1 in 3. This means that if you are dealt 10 cards, you will likely get 3 black jacks. Knowing these kinds of probabilities will help you make better decisions while playing black jack.</p>
<p>In addition, it is helpful to practice often. You can find free black jack online or practice at a casino. The more you play, the better you will become at making strategic decisions while gambling.</p>
<p>Finally, always gamble responsibly! Don’t gamble more money than you can afford to lose and don’t let gambling interfere with your daily life. Gambling should be fun and exciting, not stressful!</p>
<h1 id="‘Black-Jack-Apprenticeship-When-is-the-Right-Time-to-Double-Down-’"><a href="#‘Black-Jack-Apprenticeship-When-is-the-Right-Time-to-Double-Down-’" class="headerlink" title="‘Black Jack Apprenticeship: When is the Right Time to Double Down?’"></a>‘Black Jack Apprenticeship: When is the Right Time to Double Down?’</h1><p>As an upcoming blackjack player, you are probably looking for every advantage you can get. One such advantage is knowing when to “double down.”</p>
<p>The term “double down” comes from the game of blackjack and means exactly what it sounds like – doubling your bet after seeing your first two cards.</p>
<p>This may sound like a risky move, but there is a time and place for everything in blackjack, and doubling down can be a very advantageous play under the right circumstances.</p>
<p>When Should You Double Down?</p>
<p>There are a few things to keep in mind when deciding whether or not to double down. Chief among them are your cards and the dealer’s up-card.</p>
<p>If you have a strong hand, such as an Ace and a 10 or an Ace and a King, then doubling down is almost always the right move. This is because you have at least a 50% chance of winning the hand with just one more card.</p>
<p>If you have weaker cards, such as 2, 3, or 4, then you should only double down if the dealer has low cards showing (2 through 6). This is because the dealer has a higher chance of busting with low cards showing, which would give you a winning hand.</p>
<p>When Should You NOT Double Down?</p>
<p>There are some situations where it is not advisable to double down. One such instance is when you have two weak cards (a 4 and a 5, for example). In this case, it’s usually better to just hit instead of doubling down – unless the dealer has high cards showing (10 or higher).</p>
<p>Another situation where you should not double down is when the dealer has an Ace showing. This is because an Ace can be either high (11) or low (1), so there is no way to know for sure what the dealer’s next card will be. As such, it’s usually better to just stand in this situation.</p>
<h1 id="‘Black-Jack-Apprenticeship-How-to-Make-the-Most-of-Your-Money-While-Playing’"><a href="#‘Black-Jack-Apprenticeship-How-to-Make-the-Most-of-Your-Money-While-Playing’" class="headerlink" title="‘Black Jack Apprenticeship: How to Make the Most of Your Money While Playing’"></a>‘Black Jack Apprenticeship: How to Make the Most of Your Money While Playing’</h1><h2 id="Playing-Black-Jack-for-Fun-and-Profit"><a href="#Playing-Black-Jack-for-Fun-and-Profit" class="headerlink" title="Playing Black Jack for Fun and Profit"></a>Playing Black Jack for Fun and Profit</h2><p>One of the most popular casino games around is black jack. The premise is simple: beat the dealer’s hand total without going over 21. But there’s more to the game than just that. In order to make money while playing black jack, you need to understand the game, learn some basic strategies, and practice.</p>
<h2 id="Learning-the-Game"><a href="#Learning-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Learning the Game"></a>Learning the Game</h2><p>The first step is learning how to play. There are plenty of resources out there, including tutorials, videos, and even books. Once you understand the basics, you can start practicing. Many casinos offer free games so you can hone your skills before playing for money.</p>
<p>There are a few basic things to remember when playing black jack:</p>
<p>-First, always bet the minimum amount at each turn. This will allow you to stay in the game longer and give you more chances to win.</p>
<p>-Second, don’t bust (go over 21). This will end your turn and cost you money.</p>
<p>-Third, try to get as close to 21 as possible without busting. This gives you the best chance of winning.</p>
<p>-Fourth, never split 10s or 5s (or any other two cards with the same value). This is a bad decision and will decrease your odds of winning.</p>
<p>-Finally, if the dealer has an ace showing, he will probably offer insurance. This is a bad bet, so don’t take it.</p>
<h1 id="‘Black-Jack-Apprenticeship-A-Guide-to-Becoming-a-Master-Gambler’"><a href="#‘Black-Jack-Apprenticeship-A-Guide-to-Becoming-a-Master-Gambler’" class="headerlink" title="‘Black Jack Apprenticeship: A Guide to Becoming a Master Gambler’"></a>‘Black Jack Apprenticeship: A Guide to Becoming a Master Gambler’</h1><p>In the old days, black jack apprenticeship was a common way for aspiring gamblers to learn the ropes. Master gamblers would take on apprentices and teach them everything they knew about black jack. The apprentices would then be able to use this knowledge to make a living as professional gamblers.</p>
<p>Although black jack apprenticeship is no longer as common as it once was, it is still possible to become a master gambler by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Start by learning all there is to know about black jack. This includes learning the basic rules of the game, as well as the strategies that can help you win. There are many different resources available that can help you learn about black jack, including books, websites, and online courses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Next, practice playing black jack. You can do this by playing online or at a casino. Try out different strategies until you find ones that work best for you.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Get experience dealing with different types of players. Some players are more aggressive than others, and some are more likely to make mistakes. By dealing with a variety of players, you will be better prepared to face any situation that comes up while playing black jack.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Learn how to manage your bankroll. A good rule of thumb is to never bet more than 5% of your bankroll on any given hand. This will help ensure that you don’t lose too much money if you happen to lose a few hands in a row.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stay disciplined and don’t get impatient. Black jack can be a frustrating game at times, but it is important to stay calm and make rational decisions. If you start making bets based on emotions rather than strategy, you are likely to lose money very quickly.</p>

		<h1 id="New-Tottenham-Hotspur-FC-Flop-Causes-Embarrassment"><a href="#New-Tottenham-Hotspur-FC-Flop-Causes-Embarrassment" class="headerlink" title="New Tottenham Hotspur FC Flop Causes Embarrassment"></a>New Tottenham Hotspur FC Flop Causes Embarrassment</h1><p>Fans of Tottenham Hotspur FC were left in shock and embarrassment after their club’s new signing caused a major fiasco on his debut.</p>
<p>The £30 million signing, who was brought in to bolster the team’s attacking options, was jeered by the home fans and substituted after just 45 minutes following a series of poor performances.</p>
<p>The player, who has asked not to be named, was said to be devastated by the reaction from the fans and is said to be considering his future at the club.</p>
<p>One fan said: “It was just embarrassing. He looked like he had no idea what he was doing and he clearly wasn’t good enough for our team. I hope he leaves soon.”</p>
<p>Tottenham Hotspur FC are currently fifth in the Premier League table and will be hoping to improve on their position with some better performances from their new signing.</p>
<h1 id="Tottenham-Hotspur-FC-New-Flop-Caught-on-Camera"><a href="#Tottenham-Hotspur-FC-New-Flop-Caught-on-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Tottenham Hotspur FC New Flop Caught on Camera"></a>Tottenham Hotspur FC New Flop Caught on Camera</h1><p>Tottenham Hotspur FC new signing Serge Aurier was caught on camera making homophobic remarks about former manager Laurent Blanc and current players Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Angel Di Maria. The comments were made as part of a live Facebook video filmed by the player in Paris ahead of his move to Tottenham.</p>
<p>The footage, which was later published by French newspaper L’Equipe, shows the 24-year-old Ivory Coast right-back making a number of derogatory remarks about gay people. In one clip, he says: “He [Blanc] is someone who likes the little boys.”</p>
<p>In another, Aurier adds: “Here we say f*** you to him [Ibrahimovic], he’s like a homosexual or something. He plays with 12 players, f*** you Zlatan.” Aurier then turns his attention to Di Maria, calling him a “f****t”.</p>
<p> Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino has since confirmed that the club are aware of the incident and are investigating the matter. In a statement released on Wednesday, Spurs said: “We are aware of reports appearing in the media regarding Serge Aurier. We have been informed by Serge and his representatives that the comments were made in jest and not meant to cause offence.</p>
<p>“We have spoken with Serge who unreservedly regrets the comments and accepts that they were not meant in an offensive way. Pleased that he has understood the severity of his words, he has now apologised for any offence caused. This behaviour will not be tolerated at Tottenham Hotspur Football Club. We shall be issuing further internal disciplinary action tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Aurier has since apologised for his comments, describing them as “inappropriate and inexcusable”. In a statement posted on Twitter, he said: “I made a mistake and I want to apologise to the fans, to Laurent Blanc, to Zlatan Ibrahimovic, to Angel Di Maria and to all the football supporters around the world. I unacceptable and inexcusable comments during a live stream chat on social media yesterday. I am deeply sorry for my actions and I regret what I said 100%. These words do not reflect my personal beliefs nor who I am as a person. I am committed to represent Tottenham Hotspur FC with integrity alongside my team mates both on and off the pitch…I ask for your understanding and forgiveness.”</p>
<h1 id="Could-New-Tottenham-Hotspur-FC-Flop-Cause-More-Problems"><a href="#Could-New-Tottenham-Hotspur-FC-Flop-Cause-More-Problems" class="headerlink" title="Could New Tottenham Hotspur FC Flop Cause More Problems?"></a>Could New Tottenham Hotspur FC Flop Cause More Problems?</h1><p>The recent signing of Vincent Janssen from AZ Alkmaar for £17 million has had many Tottenham Hotspur fans excited. The 22-year-old Dutch striker is seen as one of the most promising young players in Europe, and with Harry Kane currently the only senior striker at the club, it was seen as a necessary addition.</p>
<p>But there are now concerns that the arrival of Janssen could actually create more problems for Spurs than it solves. The main worry is that Janssen is not a natural goalscorer, and may not be able to adapt to the Premier League. In his time at AZ Alkmaar, he never scored more than 10 goals in a season, and he will find it much harder to score in England’s top division.</p>
<p>This could lead to Kane being played out of position, or even being dropped from the starting line-up. This would be a disaster for Tottenham, who are already struggling to keep up with the top teams in the Premier League. If they are without their best striker and main goal threat, they could easily finish outside of the top four this season.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it remains to be seen whether Vincent Janssen will be a success or not. But if he does struggle at Tottenham, it could cause major problems for the club and their title hopes.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-Wrong-with-Tottenham-Hotspur-FC’s-New-Flop"><a href="#What-is-Wrong-with-Tottenham-Hotspur-FC’s-New-Flop" class="headerlink" title="What is Wrong with Tottenham Hotspur FC’s New Flop?"></a>What is Wrong with Tottenham Hotspur FC’s New Flop?</h1><p>In today’s inflated transfer market, where the prices for even the most average of players has skyrocketed, Tottenham Hotspur FC’s purchase of Davinson Sanchez from Ajax for a fee in the region of £42 million looks like a bargain.</p>
<p>However, Spurs fans are already starting to question manager Mauricio Pochettino’s judgement after the Colombian centre-back failed to make an impression in his first two starts for the club.</p>
<p>Sanchez was brought in as an upgrade on Toby Alderweireld, who looked set to leave White Hart Lane before Daniel Levy upped his asking price, but the 21-year-old has so far struggled to hold down a place in the Spurs side.</p>
<p>Pochettino has insisted that Sanchez will improve with time and experience, but some sections of the Tottenham support are calling for him to be dropped from the starting XI.</p>
<p>What is wrong with Tottenham Hotspur FC’s new flop?</p>
<h1 id="Tottenham-Hotspur-FC’s-New-Flop-Who-is-to-Blame"><a href="#Tottenham-Hotspur-FC’s-New-Flop-Who-is-to-Blame" class="headerlink" title="Tottenham Hotspur FC’s New Flop: Who is to Blame?"></a>Tottenham Hotspur FC’s New Flop: Who is to Blame?</h1><p>The English Premier League football club, Tottenham Hotspur FC, has just announced their newest signing: Vincent Janssen from AZ Alkmaar. The transfer fee is set at €17 million, which is a record for both clubs.</p>
<p>Janssen is a striker who had an incredible season last year in the Dutch Eredivisie. He scored 27 goals in 34 appearances, and was one of the most in-demand strikers in Europe.</p>
<p>However, this season has not gone as planned for him. He has only scored three goals in 12 appearances, and has largely been out of favor with the manager.</p>
<p>So why did Spurs sign him? Is it simply a case of bad form, or are there other factors at play?</p>
<p>There are several possible explanations for Tottenham’s decision to sign Janssen. The first is that they may believe he still has potential and can recapture his form from last season. The second explanation is that they may need cover for Harry Kane, who is currently sidelined with an ankle injury. And finally, they may simply be looking for a cheap replacement for Emmanuel Adebayor, who was released earlier this year.</p>
<p>At this point it’s difficult to say who is to blame for Janssen’s poor form: the player himself, the manager, or even the club itself. However, one thing is for sure: Spurs made a big mistake in signing him and he is likely to be nothing more than a flop at the club.</p>
