The infographic below from <a href="https://www.casinoonline.de/blackjack-apprenticeship-infographic/" target="_blank">CasinoOnline.de</a> takes a look at when and how you should be varying your bets while playing blackjack in order to have the most successful experience possible.<br /></p>
<p>The infographic provides a general overview of when you might want to increase or decrease your bets during a game of blackjack. For instance, if you have a strong hand, it might be wise to increase your bet in order to win more money. However, if the cards are going against you, it might be time to reduce your bet in order to minimize your losses. <br /></p>
<p>Additionally, there are other factors that come into play when it comes time to make a decision about whether or not to increase or decrease your bet size. For example, understanding the dealer’s upcard is important – if they have a high card up (ten or above), then they are likely to bust on their next card, so it would be wise to increase your bet at this point. On the other hand, if the dealer has a low card up (below ten), they are likely to stick with that low number, so betting big at this point would be foolish.<br /></p>
<p>By understanding when and how to vary your bets while playing blackjack, you can give yourself the best chance possible of walking away from the table as a winner.</p>
<h1 id="‘Black-Jack-Apprenticeship-Tips-on-How-to-be-a-Better-Gambler’"><a href="#‘Black-Jack-Apprenticeship-Tips-on-How-to-be-a-Better-Gambler’" class="headerlink" title="‘Black Jack Apprenticeship: Tips on How to be a Better Gambler’"></a>‘Black Jack Apprenticeship: Tips on How to be a Better Gambler’</h1><p>Part 1</p>
<p>Almost anyone can gamble. It doesn’t take any special skills or training. However, if you want to be a successful gambler, then you need to learn the proper techniques and strategies. In this article, we will discuss some tips on how to be a better black jack apprentice.</p>
<p>First of all, it is important to understand the basic rules of black jack. In order to win, your hand must be closer to 21 than the dealer’s hand - without going over 21. You can also stand pat (not ask for another card) or hit (ask for another card) depending on your hand. You should also know when to double down and when to split pairs.</p>
<p>It is also important to have a solid understanding of probabilities and statistics. For example, you should know that the odds of getting a black jack are 1 in 3. This means that if you are dealt 10 cards, you will likely get 3 black jacks. Knowing these kinds of probabilities will help you make better decisions while playing black jack.</p>
<p>In addition, it is helpful to practice often. You can find free black jack online or practice at a casino. The more you play, the better you will become at making strategic decisions while gambling.</p>
<p>Finally, always gamble responsibly! Don’t gamble more money than you can afford to lose and don’t let gambling interfere with your daily life. Gambling should be fun and exciting, not stressful!</p>
<h1 id="‘Black-Jack-Apprenticeship-When-is-the-Right-Time-to-Double-Down-’"><a href="#‘Black-Jack-Apprenticeship-When-is-the-Right-Time-to-Double-Down-’" class="headerlink" title="‘Black Jack Apprenticeship: When is the Right Time to Double Down?’"></a>‘Black Jack Apprenticeship: When is the Right Time to Double Down?’</h1><p>As an upcoming blackjack player, you are probably looking for every advantage you can get. One such advantage is knowing when to “double down.”</p>
<p>The term “double down” comes from the game of blackjack and means exactly what it sounds like – doubling your bet after seeing your first two cards.</p>
<p>This may sound like a risky move, but there is a time and place for everything in blackjack, and doubling down can be a very advantageous play under the right circumstances.</p>
<p>When Should You Double Down?</p>
<p>There are a few things to keep in mind when deciding whether or not to double down. Chief among them are your cards and the dealer’s up-card.</p>
<p>If you have a strong hand, such as an Ace and a 10 or an Ace and a King, then doubling down is almost always the right move. This is because you have at least a 50% chance of winning the hand with just one more card.</p>
<p>If you have weaker cards, such as 2, 3, or 4, then you should only double down if the dealer has low cards showing (2 through 6). This is because the dealer has a higher chance of busting with low cards showing, which would give you a winning hand.</p>
<p>When Should You NOT Double Down?</p>
<p>There are some situations where it is not advisable to double down. One such instance is when you have two weak cards (a 4 and a 5, for example). In this case, it’s usually better to just hit instead of doubling down – unless the dealer has high cards showing (10 or higher).</p>
<p>Another situation where you should not double down is when the dealer has an Ace showing. This is because an Ace can be either high (11) or low (1), so there is no way to know for sure what the dealer’s next card will be. As such, it’s usually better to just stand in this situation.</p>

The premise is simple: beat the dealer’s hand total without going over 21. But there’s more to the game than just that. In order to make money while playing black jack, you need to understand the game, learn some basic strategies, and practice.</p>
<h2 id="Learning-the-Game"><a href="#Learning-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Learning the Game"></a>Learning the Game</h2><p>The first step is learning how to play. There are plenty of resources out there, including tutorials, videos, and even books. Once you understand the basics, you can start practicing. Many casinos offer free games so you can hone your skills before playing for money.</p>
<p>There are a few basic things to remember when playing black jack:</p>
<p>-First, always bet the minimum amount at each turn. This will allow you to stay in the game longer and give you more chances to win.</p>
<p>-Second, don’t bust (go over 21). This will end your turn and cost you money.</p>
<p>-Third, try to get as close to 21 as possible without busting. This gives you the best chance of winning.</p>
<p>-Fourth, never split 10s or 5s (or any other two cards with the same value). This is a bad decision and will decrease your odds of winning.</p>
<p>-Finally, if the dealer has an ace showing, he will probably offer insurance. This is a bad bet, so don’t take it.</p>
<h1 id="‘Black-Jack-Apprenticeship-A-Guide-to-Becoming-a-Master-Gambler’"><a href="#‘Black-Jack-Apprenticeship-A-Guide-to-Becoming-a-Master-Gambler’" class="headerlink" title="‘Black Jack Apprenticeship: A Guide to Becoming a Master Gambler’"></a>‘Black Jack Apprenticeship: A Guide to Becoming a Master Gambler’</h1><p>In the old days, black jack apprenticeship was a common way for aspiring gamblers to learn the ropes. Master gamblers would take on apprentices and teach them everything they knew about black jack. The apprentices would then be able to use this knowledge to make a living as professional gamblers.</p>
<p>Although black jack apprenticeship is no longer as common as it once was, it is still possible to become a master gambler by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Start by learning all there is to know about black jack. This includes learning the basic rules of the game, as well as the strategies that can help you win. There are many different resources available that can help you learn about black jack, including books, websites, and online courses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Next, practice playing black jack. You can do this by playing online or at a casino. Try out different strategies until you find ones that work best for you.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Get experience dealing with different types of players. Some players are more aggressive than others, and some are more likely to make mistakes. By dealing with a variety of players, you will be better prepared to face any situation that comes up while playing black jack.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Learn how to manage your bankroll. A good rule of thumb is to never bet more than 5% of your bankroll on any given hand. This will help ensure that you don’t lose too much money if you happen to lose a few hands in a row.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stay disciplined and don’t get impatient. Black jack can be a frustrating game at times, but it is important to stay calm and make rational decisions. If you start making bets based on emotions rather than strategy, you are likely to lose money very quickly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
