<h1 id="Learn-How-to-Play-Blackjack-and-Be-a-Pro-in-91-Days-or-Less"><a href="#Learn-How-to-Play-Blackjack-and-Be-a-Pro-in-91-Days-or-Less" class="headerlink" title="Learn How to Play Blackjack and Be a Pro in 91 Days or Less"></a>Learn How to Play Blackjack and Be a Pro in 91 Days or Less</h1><p>In this article, we will discuss blackjack and how to play the game like a pro in 91 days or less. Blackjack is a casino game that involves betting and dealing cards. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer’s hand by either getting 21 points on your first two cards (called a “blackjack”), or by getting a higher score than the dealer without going over 21.</p>
<p>First and foremost, in order to play blackjack like a pro, you need to understand the basic rules of the game. In blackjack, you are competing against the dealer, not other players at the table. The aim is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. You score points for each card according to its numerical value - Face cards (Kings, Queens and Jacks) are worth 10 points each, and an Ace can be worth 1 or 11 points. If you get 21 points with your first two cards (the best possible hand), this is called a blackjack.</p>
<p>To begin the game, each player is dealt two cards face up - these are theirinitial hands. The dealer then deals one card face up and one card face down - this is known as the ‘hole card’. The aim of the game is then to get closer to 21 than the dealer without going over. Players can hit (take another card), stand (stick with what they’ve got), double down (double their bet and take one more card), split (if they are dealt two identical cards, they can split them into two separate hands) or insurance ( protecting themselves against dealer blackjack).</p>
<p>Once all players have either stood or busted (gone over 21), the dealers reveals his hole card and compares it to all players’ hands - if he has blackjack, all players lose apart from those who have also got blackjacks, who push (tie). The winning player is the one with the highest total score that didn’t bust - if there’s a tie, then both players win equally.</p>
<p>Now that you know some of the basics of how to play blackjack, let’s go through some tips for becoming a pro in 91 days or less!</p>
<p>#1 Start by practicing at home<br>One of the best ways to speed up your learning process when it comes to playing any new game is by practicing at home. Not only will this help improve your skills, but it will also give you a better understanding of how to play blackjack properly before hitting the casino floor. There are plenty of online resources available which can help walk you through how to play blackjack step-by-step - try searching for ‘how to play blackjack’ on Google for some great tutorials!</p>
<p>#2 Familiarize yourself with basic strategy<br>As we mentioned earlier, understanding basic strategy is key if you want to start playing blackjack like a pro. Basic strategy refers to mathematically correct plays that minimize losses while maximizing gains - something that every experienced player knows inside out. Thankfully, there are plenty of resources available online which can teach you everything you need to know about basic strategy - so make sure you do your research before hitting the tables!</p>
<p>#3 Don’t risk too much money at onceWhen starting out at blackjack, it’s important not to risk too much money at once. This way you’ll avoid losing big sums of money if things don’t go your way in the early stages of your poker career. It’s also advisable not to bet on every hand - try only betting when you feel confident about your chances of winning. By doing this, you’ll slowly but surely increase your bankroll whilst minimizing any potential losses along the way.</p>
<p>  #4 Know when to hold ‘em and know when to fold ‘emDon’t be afraid to fold if it looks like other players have better hands than you - remember, poker is all about making calculated decisions based on probability and odds rather than emotions . If another player looks like they’re aboutto beat your hand, it might be wiser justto fold insteadof taking any further risks.   #5 Stay calm and focusedIt’s crucial that during your time playing poker ,you stay calmandfocused at all times . This may sound easier said than done,but with enough practiceit can be achieved quite easily . Panicking or emotional decision making usually leadsto casinopoor playsand eventuallosses .  So remember: breathe calmly ,think rationallyand make smart choicesbased onthe situationat hand .</p>
