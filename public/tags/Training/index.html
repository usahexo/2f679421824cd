<p>There are many reasons why parents are choosing private schools over public schools in Turkmenistan. Firstly, private schools offer a higher level of education than public schools, with a greater focus on academic excellence. In addition, private schools provide smaller class sizes which allow for more individual attention from teachers. This leads to improved student outcomes and encourages a love of learning in children. Private schools also offer wider range of extracurricular activities, such as music and art programs, which help to develop well-rounded individuals. Finally, private schools typically have better facilities than public schools, with spacious classrooms and modern amenities.</p>

<p>The cost of attending a private school in Turkmenistan varies depending on the school and grade level. However, it is generally more expensive than enrolling your child in a public school. For example, the annual tuition fees for a secondary school student can range from $1,000 to $3,500. However, it is important to note that many private schools offer scholarships and financial assistance to help families cover the costs associated with attendance.</p>

<p>The quality of education offered by private and public schools in Turkmenistan varies greatly.
