#  NY to allow mobile sports betting in Aruba

The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, has announced that the state will allow mobile sports betting in Aruba. The first phase of the project is expected to be completed by the end of 2019.

Cuomo made the announcement on Wednesday, October 10th. He said that the arrangement would allow New Yorkers to place bets on their smartphones from anywhere in the state. He also said that it would create jobs and generate tax revenue.

“Today I am announcing an agreement with our partners in Aruba that will allow New Yorkers to place sports bets on their smartphones from anywhere in the state,” Cuomo said.

The governor went on to say that the project was part of a broader effort to revitalize the gaming industry in New York. He noted that the agreement with Aruba would provide a new opportunity for the state’s casinos and racetracks.

“This agreement will create jobs and generate tax revenue while helping to revive our gaming industry,” Cuomo said.

Cuomo was joined at the announcement by James Askew, the CEO ofPA Interactive Gaming LLC. Askew said that his company was looking forward to working with the state government on the project.

“We are excited to work with Governor Cuomo and his team to help deliver this new opportunity for New Yorkers,” Askew said.

The news about mobile sports betting in Aruba comes as welcome relief for New York casino operators, who have been struggling in recent years. In March 2018, Empire City Casino filed for bankruptcy protection. The casino cited competition from neighboring states as one of the reasons for its financial difficulties.

#  Aruba poised to become gambling hotspot with mobile sports betting

The Caribbean island of Aruba is set to become a gambling hotspot with the introduction of mobile sports betting, according to industry experts. With its close proximity to the US, Aruba is well-positioned to take advantage of the growing popularity of sports betting, particularly among millennials.

"Aruba is well- positioned to become a global leader in mobile sports betting, given its regulatory environment and its proximity to the United States," said Rodolphe Sepulchre, CEO of gaming technology company Gaming Innovation Group (GIG).

GIG has just launched a new mobile sports betting platform in Aruba, which will allow players to bet on events such as soccer, basketball, and boxing. The platform is available in both English and Spanish, making it accessible to a wide range of players.

Sports betting is becoming increasingly popular among millennials, who are often more comfortable using smartphones and other mobile devices than traditional gaming platforms. In fact, a recent study by Gambling Commission showed that over two-thirds (68%) of UK adults aged 18-24 had placed a bet in the past year. This suggests that there is considerable potential for growth in the global sports betting market.

Aruba has been quick to seize on this opportunity, and has created an attractive regulatory environment for online gambling operators. This has helped to attract several leading operators to the island, including GIG and partypoker.

"The regulatory framework in place in Aruba is one of the most modern in the world," said Sepulchre. "This allows us to offer a best-in-class product that meets the needs of our customers."

#  New York finally agrees to allow mobile sports betting in Aruba

New York has come to an agreement with the Caribbean island of Aruba to allow mobile sports betting within the state’s borders. The announcement was made by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Thursday, who declared that the move would create jobs and generate revenue for the state.

Cuomo said that Aruba had been looking for a partner to help them develop their mobile sports betting market, and that New York was the perfect fit. He added that the new arrangement would benefit both states, as New Yorkers would now have access to legal sports betting, while Aruba could attract more tourists with its newly-legalized gaming products.

Legal sports betting is currently available in only a few states in the US, including Nevada and Delaware. New Jersey is also slated to launch its own regulated sports betting market next month, after a long legal battle with major professional sports leagues.

Under the new agreement between New York and Aruba, both states will share in the profits from any mobile bets placed by New Yorkers within Aruba’s borders. As part of the deal, Aruba will also establish a physical presence in New York, which will include customer service agents and a support center for bettors.

#  Mobile sports betting finally coming to Aruba

After years of waiting, mobile sports betting is coming to Aruba. The government has announced that they will soon be regulating and licensing mobile sports betting providers, which will allow residents and tourists to place bets on their phones from anywhere in the country.

This is great news for Aruba, as it will bring in much-needed revenue that can be used to improve the island's infrastructure and economy. It will also provide residents with a new form of entertainment, and give tourists another reason to visit Aruba.

There are already a number of reputable mobile sports betting providers who are interested in obtaining a license to operate in Aruba. These providers offer a wide range of betting options, including popular sports such as football, basketball, and baseball. They also offer betting on less popular sports such as cricket, darts, and golf.

There is sure to be plenty of excitement surrounding mobile sports betting in Aruba. Residents and tourists can look forward to placing bets on their favourite teams and players, and hopefully winning some money in the process!

#  Aruba set to benefit from New York's new mobile sports betting regulations.

On the 18th of July, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed a bill into law that allows mobile sports betting in the state. This is great news for Aruba, as the island is well-positioned to capitalize on this new market opportunity.

Aruba has a long history of offering gambling services, and its casinos are some of the most popular tourist destinations on the island. In fact, Aruba's casino industry accounted for nearly $1 billion in revenue in 2017, making it a key part of the island's economy.

With mobile sports betting now becoming legal in New York, Aruba is well-placed to offer its services to New Yorkers looking to place bets on their favorite teams. The island has a well-developed infrastructure for online gambling, and its casinos are already equipped with the necessary technology to facilitate mobile betting.

In addition, Aruba has a strong tourism sector that can help support the growth of its casino industry. The island's close proximity to New York City makes it an attractive destination for tourists looking to place bets on sporting events.

Aruba is expected to see significant growth in its casino industry thanks to New York's new mobile sports betting regulations. With so much at stake, it's poised to become a leading player in this burgeoning market.
