#  Learn How to Play Blackjack and Be a Pro in 91 Days or Less

In this article, we will discuss blackjack and how to play the game like a pro in 91 days or less. Blackjack is a casino game that involves betting and dealing cards. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer's hand by either getting 21 points on your first two cards (called a "blackjack"), or by getting a higher score than the dealer without going over 21.

First and foremost, in order to play blackjack like a pro, you need to understand the basic rules of the game. In blackjack, you are competing against the dealer, not other players at the table. The aim is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. You score points for each card according to its numerical value - Face cards (Kings, Queens and Jacks) are worth 10 points each, and an Ace can be worth 1 or 11 points. If you get 21 points with your first two cards (the best possible hand), this is called a blackjack.

To begin the game, each player is dealt two cards face up - these are theirinitial hands. The dealer then deals one card face up and one card face down - this is known as the 'hole card'. The aim of the game is then to get closer to 21 than the dealer without going over. Players can hit (take another card), stand (stick with what they've got), double down (double their bet and take one more card), split (if they are dealt two identical cards, they can split them into two separate hands) or insurance ( protecting themselves against dealer blackjack).


Once all players have either stood or busted (gone over 21), the dealers reveals his hole card and compares it to all players' hands - if he has blackjack, all players lose apart from those who have also got blackjacks, who push (tie). The winning player is the one with the highest total score that didn't bust - if there's a tie, then both players win equally.

Now that you know some of the basics of how to play blackjack, let's go through some tips for becoming a pro in 91 days or less!
