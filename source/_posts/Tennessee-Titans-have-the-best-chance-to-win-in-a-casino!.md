The Tennessee Titans are a professional American football team based in Nashville, Tennessee. The Titans compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the American Football Conference (AFC) South division. The team plays its home games at Nissan Stadium in downtown Nashville, which is also the home of the Tennessee Titansâ€™ sister team, the Tennessee State Tigers football team of the University of Tennessee at Martin.

The Titans have had some great players over the years. One such player is quarterback Marcus Mariota, who was drafted by the team in 2015 and has since become one of their best players. Mariota helped lead the Titans to their first playoff victory in 14 years when they beat the Kansas City Chiefs 22-21 on January 6, 2018.

Another great player for the Titans is defensive lineman Jurrell Casey. Casey has been playing for the team since 2011 and was named to his third consecutive Pro Bowl on January 19, 2019. He was also voted first-team All-Pro by Associated Press (AP) for the 2018 season.
