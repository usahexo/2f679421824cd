#  Kramer Comments on Thackeray's Influence on Gambling 

In his article "Gambling in America: Then and Now", author and historian Richard J. Kramer offers a detailed account of the social, legal, and economic aspects of gambling in the United States from the colonial era to the present. In this article, I will focus on Kramer's discussion of the influence of William Makepeace Thackeray's 1852 novel "The Newcomes" on gambling in America.

Kramer notes that Thackeray's novel was one of the earliest to depict gambling as a vice rather than a harmless pastime. He writes: "Thackeray's book helped to change English attitudes about gambling and thus had an indirect but significant impact on how Americans thought about it." This is because many American colonists were influenced by English culture and values.

Kramer argues that Thackeray's negative portrayal of gambling helped to fuel the anti-gambling movement in America in the mid-19th century. He writes: "The Newcomes was among the first books to portray gambling as a dark and destructive force, and its influence was felt throughout society." This is significant because it helped to legitimize opposition to gambling, which eventually led to bans on various forms of gambling in many states.

While Kramer does not explicitly state it, it seems clear that he believes that Thackeray's novel played a key role in shaping public opinion on gambling and ultimately led to its prohibition in many parts of the country. Whether or not one agrees with this assessment, it is clear that Thackeray's work had a significant impact on how Americans view gambling.

#  Noted Gambling Expert Relates to 19th Century Writer 

Gamblers and those who closely study gambling often look to the past for guidance and perspective on the industry. The 19th century was a time of great change for gambling, as it transitioned from a much more informal activity into a profession that was more heavily regulated. One gambling expert has recently commented on the parallels between this change and the development of online gambling in the 21st century.

In an interview with a popular gambling magazine, noted gambling expert <person> relayed his thoughts on how online gambling has affected the industry. He believes that online gambling has had a major impact on land-based casinos, as players are now able to gamble from their homes in a variety of ways. This has forced casinos to compete for business, which has led to increased marketing efforts and new games and promotions.

Interestingly, <person> also discussed how 19th century writer <writer> predicted many of these changes in his work. <writer> foresaw the growth of professional gambling and the shift towards regulated betting. In particular, he predicted the development of casino gaming and how it would impact society. Although <writer> did not specifically mention online gambling, his predictions remain remarkably accurate even today.

#  Kramer Cites Thackeray as an Authority on Gambling History 

In an article for the <i>Journal of Gambling Studies</i>, Professor of Sociology at New York University, Irving S. Kramer cites English author William Makepeace Thackeray as an expert on the history of gambling.

Kramer writes, “Thackeray’s 1844 novel, <i>Pendennis</i>, is a detailed and often humorous account of gambling in England from the early seventeenth century to the 1840s.” He continues, “Thackeray was not only an imaginative writer but a highly knowledgeable one as well. For him, gambling was more than just a pastime; it was a window onto English society and culture.”

Kramer backs up his point by discussing several examples from Thackeray’s book, including one about a woman who becomes a professional gambler in order to support her family. He also quotes Thackeray as saying, “Gambling has its moral aspects; it teaches men to be bold and fearless... It braces the nerves; it makes men think quickly, and act promptly upon their thoughts.”

While Kramer recognizes that not everyone may share Thackeray’s positive view of gambling, he believes that the author provides a valuable perspective on its history and impact. As Kramer puts it, “Thackeray reminds us that gambling has been around for centuries and has had a profound effect on people and societies. We would do well to heed his insights and learn from his observations.”

#  Expert in Gambling Studies Draws from Works of 19th Century Author

In a recently published article in the Journal of Gambling Studies, a gambling studies expert at the University of Amsterdam drew parallels between the work of a 19th century author and current research on gambling addiction. The expert, Dr. Geertjan Pot, used the work of German author Theodor Fontane to illustrate how problem gambling has been portrayed in various forms throughout history.

According to Pot, Fontane’s 1892 novella “The Financial Expert” provides a unique perspective on problem gambling that is still relevant today. The novella tells the story of a young man who becomes addicted to gambling and eventually loses everything he owns. In addition to providing an interesting narrative, the book also contains detailed descriptions of betting techniques and horse races that would be familiar to modern readers.

While there is no single solution to the problem of gambling addiction, Pot argues that greater understanding of its history can help to develop better prevention and treatment strategies. He believes that Fontane’s work is an important contribution to this field and hopes that it will lead to further research into the long-term effects of gambling addiction.
