#  Learn to Play Poker Hands for Fun and Profit!

Many people enjoy playing poker, but don't really know how to play the hands. This can lead to a lot of missed opportunities and bad beats. In this article, we will teach you the basics of how to play poker hands.

The first thing you need to know is that there are five types of poker hands:

1. Royal flush
2. Straight flush
3. Four of a kind
4. Full house
5. Flush

The highest hand is a royal flush, followed by a straight flush, four of a kind, full house, and finally flush. If two players have the same type of hand, the player with the higher ranking card wins. For example, if two players have a pair of kings, the player with the king of spades would win. If there is still a tie, the pot is split evenly between the players.

Now that you know the basic rankings of poker hands, let's take a look at some specific examples:

1) A royal flush is made up of an ace, king, queen, jack, and ten all of the same suit. It is the highest possible hand in poker and therefore cannot be beaten.
2) A straight flush is made up of five consecutive cards all of the same suit. The rank of each card in a straight flush is important - for example, an ace-high straight flush would beat a 2-high straight flush. 
3) Four of a kind is made up of four cards of the same rank. 
4) A full house is made up of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank - for example three sixes and two fives).   5) A flush is made up from any five cards all of the same suit (this could be five different suits or five clubs for example).
