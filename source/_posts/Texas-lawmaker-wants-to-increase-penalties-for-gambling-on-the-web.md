#  Texas lawmaker wants to increase penalties for gambling on the web

Texas State Representative and House Speaker Pro Tem Dennis Bonnen has proposed a measure that would significantly increase the penalties for gambling online. If passed, the law would make it a felony to gamble online, punishable by up to two years in prison and a $10,000 fine.

Currently, gambling online is a Class C misdemeanor in Texas, punishable by a fine of up to $500. Under Bonnen's proposed measure, the maximum penalty for gambling online would be the same as the penalty for gambling at a casino - a felony punishable by two years in prison and a $10,000 fine.

Bonnen says that his proposal is needed to combat the growing problem of internet gambling. "Online gambling is a growing epidemic that is destroying lives and families across the country," Bonnen said in a statement. "This proposal will put an end to this scourge and send a strong message that Texas will not tolerate this form of illegal activity."

Opponents of the measure argue that it could have unintended consequences, such as driving people who gamble online underground where they would be harder to track and prosecute. They also argue that increasing the penalties for gambling will do nothing to address the underlying problem of addiction.

#  Texas is looking to crackdown on illegal gambling activity

Texas lawmakers are looking to crack down on illegal gambling activity throughout the state. The proposed bill, HB 2159, would make it a Class A misdemeanor to operate an illegal gambling device or to promote illegal gambling. The bill would also make it a Class B misdemeanor to possess an illegal gambling device.

Illegal gambling is a widespread problem in Texas. In order to address this problem, lawmakers need to pass HB 2159. This bill would help protect Texans from the negative consequences of illegal gambling, including addiction, financial ruin, and crime.

Illegal gambling can have devastating consequences for individuals and families. Gambling addiction can ruin lives and relationships. Financial ruin can befall people who lose large sums of money while gambling. Criminal activity often accompanies illegal gambling, putting people at risk of violence and incarceration.

HB 2159 would help address these negative consequences by making it easier for law enforcement officials to crackdown on illegal gambling activity. This bill would also provide much-needed education about the dangers of gambling addiction and how to seek help if you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling problem.

If you’re concerned about the impact of illegal gambling in Texas, please urge your lawmakers to support HB 2159.

#  Stiffer penalties proposed for online gambling in Texas

Online gambling is illegal in Texas, but a new proposal would stiffen the penalties for those caught engaging in the activity.

Senate Bill 649, introduced by State Senator Joan Huffman, calls for fines of up to $10,000 for individuals caught gambling online and up to $100,000 for companies caught facilitating online gambling in Texas. The bill also includes a provision that would allow the state to confiscate any assets used in connection with online gambling.

"Illegal gambling is a massive industry that preys on everyday Texans," Huffman said in a statement. "This bill cracks down on the criminal activity and protects consumers from being scammed."

Texas has been aggressive in its efforts to enforce its gambling laws in recent years. In 2017, the state reached a settlement with major internet service providers, including AT&T, Comcast and Verizon, requiring them to block access to all known illegal gambling websites.

Opponents of SB 649 argue that it will do more harm than good, punishing law-abiding Texas citizens who enjoy playing poker or other casino games online while doing nothing to combat the actual operators of illegal gambling sites.

#  Proposed bill in Texas would increase penalties for online gambling

The state of Texas is considering a new bill that would increase the penalties for online gambling. The proposed bill, House Bill 747, was introduced by State Representative Jose Menendez back in February and awaits review by the House Committee on Criminal Jurisprudence.

Under the current law, engaging in online gambling is a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail and a $4,000 fine. The proposed bill would increase the penalties to a third degree felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.

“This legislation will help keep Texans safe and protect our economy from the harmful effects of illegal gambling operations,” Menendez said in a statement when he introduced the bill.

Opponents of the bill argue that it will do more harm than good, infringing on people’s rights and leading to costly arrests and prosecutions. Supporters argue that it is important to deter people from engaging in illegal gambling activity and protect the public from its many risks.

The proposed bill is just one of many efforts around the country to crackdown on online gambling. In December last year, President Donald Trump signed into law the Safe Ports Act, which prohibits all forms of internet gambling.

#  Texas mulls harsher penalties for online gambling

The state of Texas is considering stricter penalties for those caught gambling online.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton recently testified before the state Senate Committee on Criminal Justice, in support of a bill that would increase the penalties for those caught gambling online from a Class C misdemeanor to a Class A misdemeanor.

"Gambling is illegal in Texas under both state and federal law," Paxton said. "This increase in penalty will help deter people from engaging in this criminal activity."

Paxton added that the proposed bill would also help law enforcement officials prosecute those engaged in online gambling, as the current penalty is not strong enough to deter them.

The proposed bill has been met with some criticism, with some arguing that it unfairly targets low-income individuals who may be more likely to gamble online. Others argue that the increased penalty could lead to more people being incarcerated, and is not the best way to address the issue of online gambling.
