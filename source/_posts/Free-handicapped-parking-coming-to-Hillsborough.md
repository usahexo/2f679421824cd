#  Free handicapped parking coming to Hillsborough?

The Hillsborough County Commission is currently considering a measure that would provide free handicapped parking for all county residents. The proposal was made by Commissioner Les Miller and is supported by Commissioner Sandy Murman.

"I believe that this is a very important issue, and I am proud to be leading the charge on it," said Miller in a statement. "It's vital that we make it as easy as possible for those who need handicapped parking to get it."

The measure would provide free handicapped parking permits to any county resident with a disability, regardless of whether or not they own a car. The permits would be valid at all county-owned parking facilities, including parks, libraries, and government buildings.

If passed, the measure would go into effect on January 1, 2019. It is currently awaiting review by the County Attorney's Office.

#  Why does Hardrock casino charge us for handicapped parking?

This is a question that has been asked by many people, and there doesn’t seem to be a clear answer. Hardrock casino is one of the few casinos in the area that charges for parking, and it’s especially frustrating because they have a designated handicapped parking lot.

The casino argues that it’s for safety reasons, but many people feel like this is just another way to make money off of people who are already struggling. It’s hard enough to afford to gamble, much less pay for parking, and it seems like the casino could do better by its customers.

There are plenty of other casinos in the area that don’t charge for parking, and it would be nice if Hardrock would follow their lead. In the meantime, we can only hope that they will reconsider their policy and do what’s best for their customers.

#  ReSpinners game gives back to handicapped community

The ReSpinners game is a new and innovative arcade-style mobile game that gives back to the handicapped community.

ReSpinners was created by two developers, both of whom have a family member with a disability. They wanted to create a game that was not only fun to play, but also helped support disabled people and their families.

For every 10 minutes of game play, ReSpinners donates 20 cents to the St. John’s Eve Center for Handicapped Children. This center provides services and support to disabled children and their families in the player’s home country of Romania.

The ReSpinners team is passionate about helping the handicapped community, and they hope their game will raise awareness and funds for this worthy cause. So far, they have raised over $1,000 for the St. John’s Eve Center!

#  Local man starts petition for free handicapped parking in Hillsborough

In response to the growing number of handicapped parking spots being taken up by people without disabilities, local man Tim Marks has started a petition urging the government to provide free handicapped parking for those who need it.

'It's infuriating to see people without any sort of disability taking up these spots,' says Marks. 'People with disabilities are already at a disadvantage, and it's unfair for us to have to search for parking or pay for a spot when others can just take one without any consequence.'

Marks's petition has quickly gained traction online, with over 1,000 signatures in just a few days. He is now calling on the government to take action and provide free handicapped parking for those who need it.

'It's not right that people who are less able-bodied should have to face these challenges,' Marks says. 'I hope the government will listen to our call and provide this much-needed service.'

#  Hardrock casino changing policy after local outcry over handicapped parking

The Hardrock casino in Tampa, Florida has been under scrutiny in recent weeks after local residents and advocacy groups took issue with the casino’s policy of parking handicapped people in a specially designated lot that was much further away from the casino entrance than the lot reserved for other drivers. After receiving numerous complaints, the casino has agreed to change its policy and will now park handicapped drivers as close to the casino entrance as possible.

In a statement released on Wednesday, Hardrock spokesperson Jackie Denning said that the casino had heard the concerns of local residents and would be making changes to its parking policy in order to make it more accessible for those with disabilities. “We want everyone who visits Hardrock Tampa to enjoy their experience, and that includes our guests who are visiting us with mobility issues,” said Denning.

The change in policy comes after several protests by local residents and disability rights advocates, who argued that the casino’s policy was discriminatory against those with disabilities. Some protesters even showed up at the casino on Saturday carrying signs reading “No more Handicap Parking abuse!” and “Respect our Disabilities!”

While it is unclear what exactly led to the change in policy, advocates say that they are encouraged by Hardrock’s decision and hope that it will set a precedent for other businesses in the area.
